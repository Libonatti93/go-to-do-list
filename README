Code Explanation
Example of a To-Do List in Golang
Project Structure:

Let's create a basic structure for our API, which will include:

Task Structure
Handlers for Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting Tasks (CRUD)
Simple API using net/http

Task Structure: Each task has an ID, title, and a completion field.

API Endpoints:
GET /tasks: Returns all tasks.
POST /tasks: Creates a new task.
PUT /tasks/{id}: Updates an existing task.
DELETE /tasks/{id}: Deletes a task by ID.
Server: Uses the Gorilla Mux router to manage routes, and the server is started on port 8000.

Testing the API
You can test this API using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or even curl in the terminal. For example: List Tasks: curl http://localhost:8000/tasks Create Task: curl -X POST -d '{"title":"New Task"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/tasks Update Task: curl -X PUT -d '{"title":"Task Updated","completed":true}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" :8000/tasks/1 Delete Task: curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/tasks/1
